This directory contains the raw and processed datasets used in the Energy Consumption Predictor project.

- **raw/** – place original, unmodified data files here.  The primary dataset is `global_data_on_sustainable_energy.csv`, a cleaned version of the Kaggle dataset.  Large datasets should not be committed to the repository; instead, document how to obtain them (e.g., via Kaggle links) and include only small samples if necessary.
- **processed/** – (optional) store intermediate datasets generated during preprocessing.  This folder can be created when needed and should be excluded from version control.
